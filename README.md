# MoA Procurement Tracking System Frontend

Next.js frontend for the Ministry of Agriculture procurement planning, tracking,
and reporting system.

## What this application provides

- Secure sign-in through a same-origin Next.js authentication proxy.
- Administrator user creation with email-based account invitations.
- Password creation from single-use invitation links.
- Forced temporary-password replacement for the bootstrap Administrator.
- Password-reset request and completion screens.
- Protected, role-specific dashboards.
- Session-aware sign-out.
- Ministry of Agriculture branding and consistent authentication screens.

The supported roles are:

- Officer
- Director
- Endorsing Committee
- Administrator

## Technology

- Next.js 16 App Router
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vitest

## Authentication architecture

The browser sends authentication requests to `/api/auth/*` on the frontend. The
Next.js route handler forwards approved requests to the backend and relays the
backend's session cookie.

- The session identifier is stored only in an `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Strict`
  cookie.
- Passwords and session identifiers are never stored in browser storage.
- “Remember me” stores only the user's email or username preference.
- Protected pages validate the backend session during server rendering.
- Temporary-password sessions can access only the password-change flow.
- Invited users create their first password without entering a current password.
- The user-management form accepts only name, email, and a non-Administrator
  role; it never displays a password or invitation token.
- Users are redirected to the dashboard assigned to their backend role.
- Signing out asks the backend to revoke the session before returning to sign-in.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24, matching `.nvmrc`
- npm
- The procurement tracking backend running locally or at a reachable URL

## Local setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   ```

2. Copy the environment template.

   PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   Copy-Item .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Git Bash, macOS, or Linux:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

3. Confirm that `.env.local` points to the backend:

   ```dotenv
   BACKEND_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

   `BACKEND_API_URL` is server-only. Do not rename it to a `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
   variable or expose backend credentials through it.

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open <http://localhost:3000>.

## Production configuration

- Run the frontend and backend behind HTTPS.
- Set `BACKEND_API_URL` to a URL reachable from the Next.js server.
- Keep `.env.local` and all deployment secrets out of Git.
- Configure the backend's frontend URL, CORS origin, secure session settings,
  database, invitation delivery, and password-reset delivery for the deployed
  environment.
